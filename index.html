                <h3>The goal of the School of the Worshiping Musician is to reach musicians
                    and artists who desire a deeper understanding of the theology of worship
                    in relation to their music and artistry via online offerings and
                    face-to-face seminars. Our hope at the School of the Worshiping Musician
                    is to equip and develop confident musicians and artists alike in giving
                    authentic worship to God and announcing his presence.


                </h3>
